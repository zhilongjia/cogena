Description: cogena is a workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis.
    It aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that
    may be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and
    drug repositioning based on the cogena workflow is proposed. Particularly,
    candidate drugs can be predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related
    data, or other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene expression
    of drug-related data. Moreover, the drug mode of action can be disclosed by
    the associated pathway analysis. In summary, cogena is a flexible workflow for
    various gene set enrichment analysis for co-expressed genes, with a focus on
    pathway/GO analysis and drug repositioning.
