## Introduction
To discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance, co-expressed gene set enrichment analysis, cogena, aims to cluster gene expression profiles (coExp) for gene co-expression analysis and then implement enrichment analysis for each clusters (clEnrich) based on hyper-geometric test. The results can be visulised by heatmapCluster and heatmapPEI. Based on different gene sets used, cogena can be used as a tool for pathway analysis, GO enrichment analysis, drug repositioning and so on. See [vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/cogena/inst/doc/cogena-vignette_html.html) for the detailed workflow. 

The version of cogena at github is also availiable at [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/cogena.html) (development version)
